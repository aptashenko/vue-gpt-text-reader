The first little pig was very lazy. He quickly built his house out of straw. The second little pig was a little less lazy. He built his house out of sticks. The third little pig was very wise and hardworking. He built his house out of bricks. One day, a big bad wolf came to the village. He was very hungry and wanted to eat the little pigs. The wolf went to the first house, made of straw. "Little pig, little pig, let me come in!" he said. "Not by the hair on my chinny chin chin!" said the little pig. "Then I will huff and puff and blow your house in!" said the wolf. And he did! The first little pig ran to his brother\'s house made of sticks. The wolf followed and blew down the stick house too. Both pigs ran to their brother\'s brick house. The wolf tried to blow down the brick house, but he could not. The brick house was too strong. The wolf tried to come down the chimney, but the pigs had a pot of boiling water waiting. The wolf ran away and never came back. The three little pigs lived happily ever after in the brick house.',

"I can run circles around you!" The tortoise was tired of the hare\'s boasting. "Let us have a race," said the tortoise. "I will race you to the finish line." The hare laughed. "A race? With you? That is ridiculous! But I will race you anyway. It will be easy to win." The race began. The hare ran very fast and was soon far ahead of the tortoise. He looked back and saw the tortoise was still at the starting line. "I have plenty of time," thought the hare. "I will take a nap." The hare lay down under a tree and fell asleep. Meanwhile, the tortoise kept walking slowly and steadily. He did not stop. He did not rest. He just kept going. When the hare woke up, he saw the tortoise was almost at the finish line! The hare ran as fast as he could, but it was too late. The tortoise had already won the race. "Slow and steady wins the race," said the tortoise. The hare learned that being fast is not everything. Being consistent and determined is more important.',
