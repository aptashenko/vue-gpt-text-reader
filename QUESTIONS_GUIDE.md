2. Click "Add New Text"
3. Fill in the form including `Question 1` and `Question 2`
4. Save the text

### Option 2: JSON Import (Best for Bulk)

#### Basic Format (2 questions per text):
```json
{
  "title": "Story Title",
  "content": "Story content...",
  "language": "en",
  "level": "intermediate",
  "question1": "What happened in the story?",
  "question2": "Why did the character do that?"
}
```

#### Enhanced Format (Multiple questions):
```json
{
  "title": "Story Title",
  "content": "Story content...",
  "language": "en",
  "level": "intermediate",
  "questions": [
    {
      "questionText": "What happened in the story?",
      "questionNumber": 1,
      "questionType": "comprehension",
      "difficulty": "easy"
    },
    {
      "questionText": "Why did the character do that?",
      "questionNumber": 2,
      "questionType": "analysis",
      "difficulty": "medium"
    },
    {
      "questionText": "What lesson does this story teach?",
      "questionNumber": 3,
      "questionType": "analysis",
      "difficulty": "hard"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Option 3: Import Script
```bash
# Import basic format
node import-data.js texts your-texts.json

# Import enhanced format
node import-data.js texts your-texts-with-questions.json
```

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup

To use the enhanced questions system, run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Run the contents of questions-system.sql
