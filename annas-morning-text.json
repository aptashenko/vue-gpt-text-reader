    "content": "Anna wakes up early every day. She opens the window and takes a deep breath. The sky is blue, and the birds are singing. Anna goes to the kitchen and makes a cup of tea. She eats toast with jam. After breakfast, she takes her bag and walks to work. On the way, she sees her neighbor Mr. Lee. 'Good morning!' she says. He smiles and waves. Anna likes mornings. They are quiet and peaceful.",
